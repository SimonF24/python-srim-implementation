`pysrim` is a python package that aims to wrap and extend SRIM a
popular tool for simulating ions traveling through a material. There
are many pain points to SRIM and this package aims to address
them. These inclue compatibility with all OS's, automation and crash
recovery of SRIM calculations, parsing of all output files, and
publication quality plots.

``pysrim`` is heavily tested and documented. See ``modindex`` to
search through api documentation or using the search to find a
specific function.

Please see installation for getting pysrim intalled on your
machine. Next you will want to follow the simple tutorial to get
started. For a much more advanced example please see `SiC ion damage
